# Intro to Client Routing

## The Assignment

Use a promise library to request data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/). You will need to implement basic client side routing to make appropriate fetches to the API in order to render the correct data to the page when a user clicks on a 'language' button.


## Deliverables
- an application that is build from the [webpack-simple-server](https://github.com/muktek/build--webpack-simple-server) starter kit:
- an application that uses the superagent promise library to fetch JSON data from the Rest Countries API
- an application that uses the director routing library to execute functions based on the current value in the route
- JSON data rendered to the page as HTML
- a github repository named `rest-countries-client-routing`
